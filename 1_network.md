## Network

## **VPC**

## Flowlogs, endpoints

Flow logs captures traffic of flow details in your VPC (accepted and rejected).  
Logs published to CloudWatch. You have to provide a role for it!  
Can be enabled for VPCs, subnets and network interfaces.  


## Best practices

Right CIDR block planning is the key.  
Rather use large subnets instead of lot of small subnets.  
Keep subnets simple and divide by internet accessibility.  
Use multiAZ deployments.  
Monitor flow logs.  

## **Subnets**

## Private subnet

Not directly accessible from the internet, only from inside network.  
Typically use a jump host to access resources in private subnet.  
Make your resources in private subnet available only to application servers, webservers, databases etc.

## Public subnet

Including routing table for internet gateway.  
Typically used for web application frontends for customer access.  


## Route tables

## NACL

## security groups

## **Connection to a VPC**

## Internet gateway
Allowing communication between instances in VPC and internet.
Horizontally scaled, redundant and HA.
You only provide a target in your VPC route for routing tables (internet enabled).

## VPN gateway

## Direct Connect
