## What is AWS and why to be interested

Biggest cloud provider, more than 35% market share.  
"Age of Amazon".  

## Pet vs Cattle

## Impact on style of product development

Iterative changes.  
Development / testing always in prod-like environment.


## architecture and overall methodology

It's not about "if" it fails, rather about what should happen "when" it fails.  
Because it will fail, 100% guaranteed.  
Monitoring is new testing.  

## AWS business model

Customers > Metadata (usage of AWS services) > Improvement of services > Economy of scale > Lower prices > More customers

## shared responsibility model

## trade-off with managed services

## exit strategy / migration

## new requirements

Constant monitoring, neverending loop of improvements, automatic CI/CD.  
New (automatic) processes.  
Security concepts: Blacklisting or whitelisting?
